#-------------------------------------------------------#

PROBLEM: In this problem, I performed different kinds of analysis on 
the New York City Subway fare data which can be downloaded at:
http://mta.info/developers/fare.html

After downloading the fare data from the MTA website and massaging 
the data; analysis was performed on the following 5 major fare types:
- Full fares
- Senior Citizen/Disabled fares
- 7 Day Unlimited fares
- 30 Day Unlimited fares
- Student fares 

Using MapReduce model, the top stations across all data files 
for a particular fare type were generated. Visual Analysis was also 
performed using Tableau Software.

IMPLEMENTATION: Step 1 - python download_data.py
				Step 2 - python combine_data.py
				Step 3 - python popular_stations.py
